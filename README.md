# Demand Paging Virtual Memory Simulator

This assignment deals with developing a simulation program that helps us study various 
paging algorithms. The simulator simulates a number of local page replacement algorithms.
Each run of the simulator reads from the STDIN a reference string that models some hypothetical process
and the program outputs a number of statistics about the performance of the algorithm.
